# GoPair 🚖  
A next-generation **taxi-sharing platform** with AI-driven safety monitoring, flexible ride options, and a sustainability-first approach.

## 🚀 Overview  
GoPair is a **ride-sharing platform** that allows individuals to share **two-wheeler or four-wheeler rides** while ensuring safety and efficiency using AI-based monitoring. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, GoPair focuses on **peer-to-peer ride-sharing**, making commuting more affordable, sustainable, and flexible for drivers and riders alike.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Flexible Ride-Sharing:** Users can switch between "Pilot" (driver) and "Partner" (rider) modes.
- **AI-Powered Safety:** Utilizes **GPS, gyroscopes, and speed tracking** to monitor ride safety in real-time.
- **Free Rides Through Ads:** Option for riders to watch ads in exchange for free or discounted rides.
- **Eco-Friendly Travel:** Reduces **carbon emissions** by maximizing ride occupancy.
- **Earning Potential:** Drivers (Pilots) can **set their own fares** and **keep more revenue** compared to traditional services.
